# Calendar Generator

This project is a Python application that generates a rotation-based calendar for a given year and a list of names. The generated calendar is saved as an Excel file.

## Files

- `calendario.py`: This is the main script that generates the calendar. It contains the `createCronogram` function which takes a year and a list of names as input and generates the calendar.

- `Ui.py`: This script creates a simple GUI for the application. It allows the user to input the year and the names, and then generates the calendar when the "Generar" button is clicked.

- `excel/result.xlsx`: This is where the generated calendar is saved.

## Usage

1. Run `Ui.py` to start the application.
2. Enter the names in the "Nombre" fields.
3. Enter the year in the "AÃ±o" field.
4. Click the "Generar" button to generate the calendar. The calendar will be saved as `excel/result.xlsx`.
