**Final Conclusion:**

There exists an arrangement of 8 queens on a chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

**Logical Statement:**

∃x1...n (∀y1...8 (R(x1,y1) → ¬∃w ∈ {1,...,n}, w ≠ x1 (R(w,y1))) ∧
(∀z ∈ {1,...,n} (R(z,1) → ¬∃w ∈ {1,...,n}, w ≠ z (R(w,1)))) ∧
(∀x ∈ {2,...,n} (∀y ∈ {1,...,8} (R(x,y) → ¬∃w ∈ {1,...,n}, w ≠ x ((w > x) ∧ (|y - 1| < |w - x|))))) ∧
¬(∃x ∈ {1,...,n} (∀y ∈ {1,...,8} (R(x,y) → ∃z ∈ {1,...,n}, z ≠ x (R(z,y))))

**Interpretation:**

This logical statement asserts the existence of a configuration where 8 queens are placed on the chessboard in such a way that none of them attack each other. The first part of the statement ensures that no two queens share the same row or column, while the second and third parts ensure that no queen attacks any other queen diagonally. The final part negates the possibility of a circular permutation where all 8 queens are placed in the same position.

**Mathematical Representation:**

This logical statement can be represented mathematically as:

∃x1,...,x8 (1 ≤ x1 < x2 < ... < x8 ≤ 64) ∧
¬(∃i,j,k,l ∈ {1,...,8} (i ≠ j ∧ k ≠ l ∧ i = k ∧ j = l))

where xi represents the position of each queen on the chessboard.
